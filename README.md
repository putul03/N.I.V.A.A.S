# N.I.V.A.A.S
Networked Intelligent Voice and Advanced Automation System

## Overview

The Gesture and Voice-Controlled Smart Home Automation System is a project that enables users to control various home appliances, enhance security, and improve energy efficiency through gestures and voice commands. This README provides an overview of the project, how it works, and how to set it up.

## Features

- Gesture recognition for controlling lights, fans, and other appliances.
- Voice control with integration into popular voice assistants.
- Customization options for personalized commands.
- Integration with existing smart home devices.
- Strong focus on privacy and security.
- Energy-efficient operation with motion sensors.
- Real-time feedback and remote access.
- Low-latency gesture recognition for seamless control.
- Voice control using LLM (Large Language Model)
- Integration with lighting, HVAC, security, and entertainment systems.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python installed on your system.
- Required Python packages such as OpenCV and Mediapipe.
- Access to a camera for gesture recognition.
- Compatible smart home devices for integration.

## Installation

1. Clone the project repository from https://github.com/putul03/N.I.V.A.A.S.git
2. Install the required Python packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up your camera for gesture recognition.
4. Configure voice assistant integration as needed.

## Usage

1. Run the project using `python main.py`.
2. Perform gestures to control lights, fans, and other appliances.
3. Give voice commands to the integrated voice assistant for control.
4. Customize commands and settings in the configuration files.

## Configuration

- Configure gesture recognition settings in `gesture_config.yaml`.
- Customize voice control settings in `voice_config.yaml`.
- Modify integration settings in `integration_config.yaml`.

## Limitations

- Gesture recognition accuracy may vary depending on lighting conditions.
- Voice control requires an internet connection for voice assistant integration.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more advanced gestures and commands for a broader range of appliances.
- Enhance security features and add user authentication.
- Support additional voice assistants and platforms.
- Improve gesture recognition performance under various conditions.
